Overview
Polarization of point of views is happening due to social media.  While this is a good thing,
things can go south spirally and cause protests, violence, riots, etc. It also can provide easy access to
weapons, drugs etc. The information gathering from social media can help predicting the violent
disturbances before the situation worsens and predicting it in early stage can help alert the security
forces to control any such violences.
Using regional crime statistics information available on various dataset providers we will detect crime
patterns. Studying these patterns will help us in extraction of attributes. These attributes will play
important role in predicting crime in particular region by calculating crime rate and violence rate.
Based on these parameters we will have output as binary classification indicating violent disturbance
predictor (0 for no and 1 for yes). After training our model, we are targeting that when we test the
model it should correctly predict the upcoming violent disturbance event in specific region which can
help us in taking necessary measures to avoid major consequences like riots, mass protest etc.
